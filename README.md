# Sound_Level_Monitoring_Advanced_Technicians_Certificate_End_Year_Project

The Pedagogical Sound Monitoring project aims to make users aware of noise pollution. The capture of the sound of the environment makes it possible to display the sound level live accompanied by an alert message.

For this project we were 4:
 - the first one did the Raspberry part, he had to make sure he captured and saved the sound on the database
 - the second one did the Smartphone app, he had to make a mobile application in xamarin to login as user and to see the sound recorded live
 - the third one did the web site, he had to make a web site to login as admin, the admin can see the sound recorded live, he can manage other user accounts and he can modify the sound level threshold and the message that appear when we see the sound recorded
 - the last one did the API and the database, he had to ensure that everyone could have access to information in real time according to their authorizations
 
 I do the Web site by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I made the whole website without using any framework.
